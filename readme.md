##Coding Fun

- Users can set up a basic study site that allows them to organize the resources they discover online as well as create notes in markdown while previewing them live and save these notes. They can also link up their github accounts to track their progress as they learn new information


###UX

- Users can save online resources they have found and organize these into sections they can then search through
- Users can take notes in markdown and then preview this live and save the notes to refer back to later
- Users can link their github account to view the status of their commits etc..


####Stretch UX

- Users can star/vote on online resources, this then adds it to a main page that is viewable by anyone accessing the site
- Users can build a schedule/timetable. Include some sort of daily diary application


###Design

- Built using skeleton.js, build out own helper classes and improve the design and UX experience
- Simple interface, self explanatory to use
